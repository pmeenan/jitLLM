# Rough edges — findings log

CUDA driver, DGX Spark platform, toolchain, and library bugs, quirks,
surprising limits, performance cliffs, and missing capabilities encountered
while building jitLLM. Log the ones that burned real debugging time and will
bite again — this is a save-future-you log, not a compliance artifact.

**Before adding:** grep for the API/library involved to avoid duplicates.
**Before debugging weirdness:** check here first — it may be known.

A good entry says what environment it happened in (workstation or Spark,
driver, toolkit, compiler versions) and what was observed vs. expected;
include a reproduction when it's cheap to capture. Platform constraints that
were known from documentation before any code existed (Spark's
compatibility-mode-only GDS, no GPUDirect RDMA) are recorded as fixed points
in [architecture.md](architecture.md) and D-004, not here; this log is for
what the documentation did not tell us.

Format:

```
## RE-NNN: Title  (YYYY-MM-DD, status: open | fixed-upstream | worked-around | wontfix)
Environment / Repro or measurement / Observed / Expected / Impact / Links
```

Newest first. RE-numbers are never reused.
